# Steps Tracker Challenge
Build a simple Fitness Tracker Dashboard app using Flutter and BLoC architecture, that fetches real step count data from the health package.

### **__Requirements:__**
- Display today’s steps count (from health package)
- Show a progress bar towards a daily goal of 10,000 steps
- Show the last 7 days’ steps in a list (e.g., “Mon – 8230 steps”).
- Add pull-to-refresh on the dashboard. (When pulled, trigger a BLoC event to re-fetch today's step data.)
- Show loading spinner when fetching data from health.

### **__Bonus(optional):__**
- Show percentage completion for each day (of the 10,000 target).
- Let user set a custom daily goal.
- Add unit tests for the BLoC
- Handle possible error with a retry button.
